# Introduction to OKX API V5

OKX provides a comprehensive suite of REST and WebSocket APIs to help you programmatically interact with our trading platform. This documentation covers our V5 API, which is the latest and recommended version.

## API Overview

### REST API
- Base URL: `https://www.okx.com`
- All endpoints return either a JSON object or array
- All time and timestamp related fields are in milliseconds
- HTTP `4XX` return codes are used for malformed requests; the issue is on the sender's side
- HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on OKX's side
- Any endpoint can return an error

### WebSocket API
- Public Channel: `wss://ws.okx.com:8443/ws/v5/public`
- Private Channel: `wss://ws.okx.com:8443/ws/v5/private`
- Real-time market data and account updates
- More efficient than REST API for receiving updates
- Requires maintaining an active connection
